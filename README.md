## üîß Technical Implementation

### VRF Challenge Generation
```cadence
// Generate VRF-based daily challenge
pub fun generateDailyChallenge(user: Address, day: UInt64): UInt64 {
    // Get VRF randomness from Flow's Random Beacon
    let blockHeight = getCurrentBlock().height
    let randomSource = RandomBeaconHistory.sourceOfRandomness(atBlockHeight: blockHeight - 1)
    
    // Create deterministic seed from VRF + user + day
    let seed = String.join([randomSource.toString(), user.toString(), day.toString()], separator: ":")
    let hash = HashAlgorithm.SHA3_256.hash(seed.utf8)
    let randomValue = UInt64.fromBigEndianBytes(hash) ?? 0
    
    // Select challenge based on user's fitness level
    return selectChallenge(randomValue: randomValue, userStats: getUserStats(user))
}
```

### Account Linking Integration
```typescript
// Link social accounts for recovery
const linkAccount = async (provider: string) => {
    await fcl.authenticate({
        service: {
            f_type: 'Service',
            f_vsn: '1.0.0',
            type: 'authn',
            uid: `${provider}-link`,
            endpoint: `https://fcl-discovery.onflow.org/testnet/authn/${provider}`,
            provider: {
                name: provider,
                description: `Link your ${provider} account for social recovery`
            }
        }
    })
}
```

### Sponsored Transactions
```cadence
// All user transactions are sponsored
transaction() {
    prepare(signer: AuthAccount) {
        // User signs, but FlowFit pays gas
        FitnessChallenge.updateProgress(user: signer.address, progressValue: progress)
    }
}
```
